# Project Title

Scripts to generate .ctl input files for MPB and MEEP electromagnetic codes to simulate
photonic topological insulator cavities as in:

G. Siroki, P. A. Huidobro and V. Giannini, Phys. Rev. B(Rapid) 96, 041408 (2017) 

based on the photonic topological insulator design described here:

L. Wu and X. Hu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 223901 (2015)


## Getting Started

To compile type 
```
g++ -o scriptName scriptName.cc
```

### Dependencies

(Optional) the .cell file can be used to quickly visualize the structure in the generated .ctl
file using JMol.
